DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

What you must do is create a folder inside here named (<d2cr>\data\custom\<yourfolder>).

Your folder should have no spaces, and be 12 characters or less. Referred to as
<yourfolder> from now on.

Inside this folder you will find 3 files, npc_heroes_template.txt, npc_abilities_template.txt,
and items_template.txt

Copy these files to <yourfolder> and rename them to npc_heroes.txt, npc_abilities.txt, and items.txt.

Edit these files as you see fit. Damage, cooldowns, whatever you want!

Here's the tricky part. Right click <yourfolder> and zip it or rar it. Something to make sure
that there is an archive of your files with the folder as the first thing.

So it should then be somethingsomething.zip\<yourfolder>\npc_heroes.txt items.txt and npc_abilities.txt

You then have to upload this folder to the internet (I suggest mediafire.com or mega.co.nz).

In the client, select start game and then check the box "Enable" in Custom Mod. A small dropdown will appear
near the checkbox, this is where you select whatever you named <yourfolder>.

When players join your lobby, you must make sure they download your somethingsomething.zip
and extract it into their <d2cr>\data\custom folder.

Again, if the mod folder is pudgewars, every player needs to have the modified files in
<d2cr>\data\custom\pudgewars folder.

If a player does not have it, you will be unable to start the game and the players without the mod
will be displayed.
